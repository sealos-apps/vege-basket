# Incremental database migrations

`server/schema.ts` remains the idempotent bootstrap schema used by the application
and by `db:init`. Every change to a table, constraint, or index must also add a new
timestamped SQL file in this directory. Migration files are append-only: do not
edit a file after it has been applied, and do not add an automatic down migration.

For each schema change:

1. Add the forward-only SQL to a new file named
   `YYYYMMDD_<short-description>.sql`.
2. Keep the corresponding idempotent definition in `server/schema.ts` so a fresh
   database and a legacy database can converge on the same shape.
3. Add or update schema assertions in the relevant server test.
4. Record the deployment plan for the change. A compatible schema addition may be applied by the
   existing idempotent `schemaSql` startup path; data, destructive, and incompatible changes
   still require an explicitly approved migration run before dependent code is deployed.

The current migrations are:

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `20260828_organization_package_market_policy.sql` | Adds organization feature settings, independent release/CI package-market policies, selected rule rows, and the lookup index. |
| `20260828_organization_package_market_policy_excluded_mode.sql` | Extends the channel-policy mode constraint with the `excluded` deny-list mode. |
| `20260828_organization_package_market_policy_shared_selection.sql` | Adds one canonical organization-wide visibility range and safely derives it from legacy channel policies without broadening package access. |
| `20260904_test_environments.sql` | Adds reusable encrypted organization test environments, space assignments, and nullable Bug environment references with assignment integrity. |
| `20260904_test_space_version_uniqueness.sql` | Adds the encrypted test-space version lookup and organization-scoped uniqueness index. |
| `20260908_test_bug_verification_packages.sql` | Adds immutable Bug verification submissions and selected package snapshots. |
| `20260909_test_bug_verification_deliveries.sql` | Adds encrypted container-image delivery snapshots and one immutable acceptance comment per verification submission. |
| `20260908_weekly_report_assignees.sql` | Adds the organization membership flag used by the long-lived weekly report assignee list and excludes the reserved admin account. |

For the organization package-market policy release, update the image only. API startup applies
the matching idempotent `schemaSql` definition, so no manual `psql` or `db:init` run is required.
The database role must have normal DDL permissions for the new policy tables and constraint.
Missing policy rows resolve to the enabled, all-visible default; the old
`organization_package_markets` table is deliberately left untouched and unused.

Run these files manually only against the explicitly selected `DATABASE_URL`, after taking the
required backup and receiving authorization for that environment:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --set=ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file=server/migrations/20260828_organization_package_market_policy.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --set=ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file=server/migrations/20260828_organization_package_market_policy_excluded_mode.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --set=ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file=server/migrations/20260828_organization_package_market_policy_shared_selection.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --set=ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file=server/migrations/20260904_test_environments.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" --set=ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file=server/migrations/20260908_weekly_report_assignees.sql
```

The files are wrapped in one transaction and remain append-only structural records. The
application does not execute versioned migration files at startup; it executes the current
idempotent `schemaSql` compatibility definition. Do not rely on that startup path for future
data transformations, destructive cleanup, or incompatible migrations.
